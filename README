This is a C++ implementation of "Dickson double algebras".

Definitions are taken from "On Quaternions and Octonions" by John
H. Conway and Derek A. Smith.

test/laws.cxx verifies various quaternion identities, octonion
identities, and general Dickson identities, as well as their
classifications.  These identities are taken partly from Conway's
book.

Note that for very large algebras you may need to define
DICKSON_USE_HEAP to avoid blowing the stack.
